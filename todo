 - encode the tableaux calculus for classical propositional logic into
   Coq;

 - encode the truth table semantcs of classical propositional logic
   into Coq;

 - encode an effective procedure for searching for tableaux calculus
   proofs inside Coq;

 - prove the following theorems:

    Thm 1: if the formula A has a tableaux proof then it is valid.

    Thm 1: if the formula A is valid then it has a tableaux calculus
    proof.

 - now extract the code that does proof search from Coq to obtain an
   automatically generated theorem prover for classical propositional
   logic

 - if, as I suspect, you knock this off easily, then we move to move
   complicated logics until you are happy.
